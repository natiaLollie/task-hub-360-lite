## Lessons Learned 
_Things I learned while building this project, challenges I faced and how I overcame them_

 Some of my key takeaways include a developing a deeper understanding of the distinctions between SQL and NoSQL databases. Much of my prior experience was centered around SQL databases. However, this project has equipped me to make more informed decisions when it comes to choosing the right database for various projects. I also delved deeper into the world of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, further developing the art of manipulating data within a MERN stack application. Additionally, I expanded my skill set by exploring API integrations, allowing me to seamlessly connect and interact with external services and data sources, enriching the functionality of this project.
